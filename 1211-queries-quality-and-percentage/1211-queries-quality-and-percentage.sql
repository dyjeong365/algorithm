We define query quality as:
The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:
The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
